Many scientific purists argue that modern engineering inventions stem directly from science, suggesting that scientific theory is essential and must always precede invention.

Yet, a closer look at history reveals a far more complex, non-linear relationship between science and engineering. For instance, the invention of the wheel predates Newton's laws of motion by millennia. Similarly, ancient marvels like the Persian water wheel and the sophisticated docks of the Indus Valley thrived long before their scientific principles were formally understood.

In fact, such examples imply that engineering often leads, with scientific theories arriving later to explain the underlying principles.

Could we be witnessing a similar dynamic in neuroscience? Might AI breakthroughs pave the way for neuroscience to follow?
