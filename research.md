Here are links to my research articles:

- [**Whole-Brain Network Models: From Physics to Bedside**](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/computational-neuroscience/articles/10.3389/fncom.2022.866517/full) - Here we review the field of large scale whole brain computational models.
- [**Biophysical mechanism underlying compensatory preservation of neural synchrony over the adult lifespan**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-022-03489-4) - Here we combine dynamical systems modelling with MEG analysis to understand age-related neural compensations.
